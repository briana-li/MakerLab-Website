				<h2>Eduardo Beltrame molecules of life with NIH</h2>
				<p>Undergraduate comes into the lab thinking 3D printing is science fiction, and develops a process to download protein data sets from the protein data bank, and render them in a molecular visualizer suitable to be 3D printed.  He downloads and renders over 50 proteins on his own from the protein data bank that have never been physicalized before.  The work is noticed by the National Institutes of Health and in collaboration with them he publishes as an undergraduate a technique for how to use low end consumer 3D printers to make copies of proteins that have never been printed before.  He works closely with Professor Krummel’s Biochemistry class teaching students to print molecules for other students.  This revolutionizes the way that they teach molecular biology, moving it from 3D projection to physical objects that every student can take home with them.

				<h2>Daniella Dimitrova - Rose Art Museum, Louise Nevelson Exhibition</h2>
				<p>Daniela Dimitrova, one of our valuable MakerLab family members and a Rose Art Museum intern, has created this exhibition in virtual reality. Now you can put on your augmented reality headset to take a tour. Thank you Rose Art Museum for sharing this picture with the caption "Deputy Director Kristin Parker tests out the Oculus Rift ...</p>
                <p>Daniela Dimitrova an undergraduate from the Fine Arts department, who also came to the MakerLab thinking that virtual reality and 3D printing were science fiction.  In collaboration with another undergraduate she founded the Virtual Reality club.  She learned Unity and Unreal Engine and created a lighting-accurate copy of the Rose Art Museum, where they can not only prestage exhibits to see how they will flow in the space, they can re-create past exhibits that no longer exist -- including Louise Nevelson’s exhibit from the 1960’s that was lost in a fire.  After creating the virtual space, Daniela created a 1:1 scale copy of the artwork lost in the fire, 3D printing over 20 pieces that assembled into a photo-realistic recreation of the lost sculpture.

				<h2>Andrew Koh's Greece Fieldwork</h2>
				<p>Professor Koh is a professor in the Chemistry and Classics departments, and teaches in both.  The Brandeis MakerLab partnered with the Digital Humanities Lab to advance what’s possible for his field research.  We bought a field kit to Greece for the summer of 2016 to work with the Herakleon Museum digitizing ancient objects from warrior tombs dating between 3000 and 5000 BC.  The 3D scans were so accurate that we were able to perceive fingerprints on pottery never before noticed.  There are plans through 2020 to do additional field work each summer, including aerial 3D scans of tomb excavations and preservation through the use of digitization techniques of tomb exteriors before excavation.  Professor Koh is excited that this will provide major leaps in what’s possible for modern Archaeology.
                </p>
                <p>Brandeis <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/classics/clarc/">CLARC</a> (Classical Artifact Research Collection) undergraduate research students are involved in this effort.  They are involved in the processing of 3D scan data.  Also, while there were no undergraduates from Brandeis on site this past summer, they plan to bring Brandeis undergraduates in future summers.  It’s a real Brandeis undergraduate research opportunity.

				<h2>CLARC interns</h2>
				<p>CLARC (Classics Artifact Research Collection) - in summer 2006 about 800 ancient archaeological objects were discovered by AOKO in the Rose Art Museum, acquired by a past professor and left behind and forgotten when he moved on.  AOKO rediscovered them.  In Fall 2006 Classics began a formal year-long internship program where undergraduates research and document ancient artifacts.  The MakerLab has been working with them for 3 years now helping with digitization, both 2D object photography and 3D scanning, and 3D printing and reproductions.  This gives the undergraduates not just access to a physical duplication of the object that they can take with them, it also teaches them fundamental skills about the future of digital curation and preservation.

				<h2>Tory Fair's 3D Scans for Sculpture Class</h2>
				<p>Professor Tory Fair teaches a class in the Fine Arts department on sculpture, where as part of the course undergraduate students create a one to one copy of their whole head. For the last couple of years, Prof. Fair has partnered in the MakerLab to use 3D scanning technologies to duplicate a bust of their head digitally, comparing it with the hand-based analog tools.  Through this comparison, students learn different approaches to how to represent figures, and examine the difference between perfect digital copies and what one can produce as an artist by hand -- exploring digital artifacts, the nature of what we see, and how artistic expression is different from reproduction.
                </p>
                <p>Similar to some of the work done by Scott Weiner, photography professor, who is interested in forcing the technology into a glitch to reveal what is possible with this new toolset - what do images captured with this lead to?  Scott asked for 2 hours a couple of days a week to spend with the MakerLab.  This will lead to curricular materials for Scott’s class as well as providing MakerLab with envelope-pushing PD in depth use of the tools.  He’s also digitizing 4x6 negatives and using photogrammetry to render the environment at very high megapixels.  Plus, he’s very talented and a good technician.

				<h2>Vivek's High School Summer Programs - Krummel's Stories</h2>
				<p>Summer 2015  we had six Waltham High School students participate in a program (designed by Vivekanand Pandey Vimal, Professor Krummel, Anique Olivier-Mason and Eduardo Beltrame), where they learned about Biochemistry and DNA, with 3D printed molecules to help them visualize. You can read more about this program at Brandeis Library and Technology Services' blog.
                </p>
                <p>PhD researcher Vivek got a Spark grant through the HFIC to bring half a dozen Waltham High School students into a program of hands-on research in Brandeis science labs.  In partnership with Brandeis’s MRSEC division, Vivek assembled a team of ten graduate students and staff to teach lessons on the fundamental building blocks of biology.  The MakerLab assisted in 3D printing molecular models including a capstone project that was a 5 foot tall DNA strand.

    				<p>"In my dissertation research I am studying how people maintain balance, and the role that the vision, the inner ear's balance organ, and gravity plays in that. We took some data from one of our experiments, and turned that into a 3d printed sculpture that represents that data in such a way that you can gain a different understanding from it, compared to "just" looking at a 2d graph on a screen. This was a collaboration with Vivekanand Pandey Vimal (who provided the data) and Alberto Pierobon (who helped with designing the stand) with a tremendous amount of support from Brandeis University LTS Maker Lab (Ian Roy, Hazal H Uzunkaya, Ben Levin) and Brandeis 3D Printing Club - Deis3D (Gabe Seltzer).

                    <h2>Brandeis Prosthetics Club <span class="tag">completed</span></h2>
                    <p>A group of Brandeis students have started this club in order to understand and develop prostheses. The Prosthetics in the market can cost up to $50,000, by 3D printing we can reduce this price to $50. Now kids don't have to wait until they stop growing to get one, and this is very important in their neuro-muscular development. Right now the club members are trying to master the designs found in the e-NABLE community's website. Once they get certified they will put their first prosthetic hand on a kid. While they work on their 3D printing and design skills, they are also hoping to start strong relations with Boston Children's Hospital to help the children in need.
