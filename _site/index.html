    				<h2>Devi Acharya</h2>
    				<p>A Collaboration with artist Tommy Hartung creating 3D sculptures for film projects at the Rose Art Museum. Devi is a double majoring in Computer Science and Film, Television, and Interactive Media, and spends her time making tech and art projects with the Getz Media Lab, Deis3D, VR Club, and other groups around Brandeis. She is currently working with the Makerlab as a Maker-in-Residence bringing together art and technology through 3D printing. Working with artist and filmmaker Tommy Hartung, I am creating 3D printed figures that Hartung will be using on animations and experimentation with new materials. These short films, along with the figures, will be on display in an upcoming solo exhibition at the Rose Art Museum.

    				<h2>Liz Washington</h2>
    				<p>I will be creating five sculptures this semester that will be on exhibit at Brandeis in December. I hope to incorporate 3D printing into at least three of these Pieces. One sculpture that I have begun is an industrial planter. This sculpture is about fourteen cubic inches and is composed of layered cubes. The inner cube is twelve cubic inches and is composed of six mirrors. Surrounding this cube is another cube two-inches in diameter that is 3D printed. The 3D printed cube is composed of smaller cubic subunits, that themselves contain cubes. This creates a grid system around the reflective cube that will allow vines to grow through and around it. A rough drawing is provided to the left. The piece will provide the viewer with an aesthetically pleasing mix of industrial and natural components. It works comment on the way that nature interacts with new technologies; overtime as the vines thrive, they will begin to overtake the industrial components as a whole and the piece will appear to be entirely made of vines and leaves. This process is indicative of nature’s ability to preserve against all odds.

    				<h2>Matt Groth</h2>
    				<p>Can neurofeedback aid a mindfulness meditation practice using a consumer EEG? Muse claims that is what their product does, but there is little public scientific data supporting this claim. I first became interested in the question after reading an opinion article on the subject published in 2013. Brandmeyer and Delorme suggest that in theory neurofeedback could help beginner meditators by alerting them when their mind wanders. I've designed an experiment(attached in email) that has already been approved by the Brandeis Institutional Review Board to test this theory with the Emotiv, however I would need to purchase Emotiv's Raw EEG Software to be able to publish my research. This software however is too expensive, and only allows a very limited number of recordings. Instead I would like to purchase an OpenBCI setup, and redesign my experiment for it. For my experiment, I will need to collect EEG data for 2 purposes: quantifying success in the interventions and giving subjects feedback when their mind wanders, like the muse does. One study has found that theta and delta activity increase during mind wandering while alpha and beta decrease, so I will give real-time feedback along these lines. I will do preliminary tests with many other feedback algorithms before deciding which to use the actual experiment. The OpenBCI system will provide me not only with all of the hardware, but also a lot of useful software. The GUI it comes with will be a lot more informative than the software I have now for the Emotiv, such as live graphing of data. Additionally, I will be able to place the electrodes wherever I want rather than using Emotiv's fixed headset. OpenVibe software will allow me to easily design and test different feedback algorithms.

    				<h2>Josh Goldberg</h2>
    				<p>I am building a life size model of the Master Sword from the Legend of Zelda. I am interested in this further advance my skills in 3D printing as well as develop new skills including sand-casting, welding, and working in a metal workshop. As this project will help me advance my skills in craftsmanship, it also brings a nostalgic benefit and be therapeutically relaxing and exciting. Being able to fully complete my first ever large project like this will bring me an incredible sense of achievement and joy. After the sword is complete, I do hope to print a life-size stand that was seen in the Temple of Time in the game to hold the prop. The advantage of building the sword also provides a marketing benefit, because each of these swords that are sold by Nintendo cost around 1000-2000 thousand dollars, where we can produce a metal Master Sword costing near 400$ total and sell it for a cheaper price of 750$. Any amount sold higher than its cost, will be a profit and those additional funds can provide assistance for other projects.
