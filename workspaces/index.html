        <p>The Digital Humanities Lab brings together students and faculty to pursue humanistic research questions through digital tools, methods, and practices. Current endeavors include undergraduate work on the <a href="http://www.homermultitext.org/" target="_blank">Homer Multitext Project</a> and support for the digitization efforts of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/classics/clarc/Classical"> Artifact Research Collection</a> interns. The DH Lab is also home to the <a target="_blank" href="https://moulianaproject.org/">Mouliana Project</a> which is seeking to employ the best technological and scientific methods to the practice and teaching of archaeology. Individuals or groups with ideas for projects or that are looking for digital resources are welcome to stop by or email.

        <p>Farber Classroom is a computer lab that hosts classes year-round and is available as a study space to students during off-hours.  It seats 35 students and one instructor, has a projector at the front of the classroom, and a high-volume printer towards the back.  All of the lab computers (excluding 3 PCs) have Windows OS virtualization as well as a host of academic software to support students and instructors who require computers for their lessons.  We've recently partnered with the MakerLab to expand our hardware and software offerings to include CAD, VR, game design, and molecular modeling among others.
