- name: Balance Maintanance Study
  description: "Sacha Panic was a PhD graduate student in cognitive neuroscience. In his dissertation research he studied how people maintain balance, and the role that the vision, the inner ear's balance organ, and gravity plays in that. He took some data from one of his experiments, and turned that into a 3D printed sculpture that represents that data in such a way that one can gain a different understanding from it, compared to \"just\" looking at a 2D graph on a screen. This was a collaboration with Vivekanand Pandey Vimal (who provided the data) and Alberto Pierobon (who helped with designing the stand) and Brandeis University LTS Maker Lab."

- name: Waltham High School Summer Program
  description: "Summer 2015 we had six Waltham High School students participate in a program (designed by Vivekanand Pandey Vimal, Professor Krummel, Anique Olivier-Mason and Eduardo Beltrame), where they learned about Biochemistry and DNA, with 3D printed molecules to help them visualize. You can read more about this program at Brandeis Library and Technology Services' blog. PhD researcher Vivek got a Spark grant through the HFIC to bring half a dozen Waltham High School students into a program of hands-on research in Brandeis science labs. In partnership with Brandeis’s MRSEC division, Vivek assembled a team of ten graduate students and staff to teach lessons on the fundamental building blocks of biology. The MakerLab assisted in 3D printing molecular models including a capstone project that was a 5 foot tall DNA strand."

- name: "House of the Vetii"
  description: "Priyam Shah, an undergraduate from the Neuroscience department created House of the Vettii, a Roman townhouse located in the ancient city of Pompeii. The house is two-scale, as it was in Rome, you can walk around and meet virtual people — shopkeepers, even people playing chess on the steps of the Roman Basilica."

  description: "Daniela Dimitrova an undergraduate from the Fine Arts department, who also came to the MakerLab thinking that virtual reality and 3D printing were science fiction. In collaboration with another undergraduate she founded the Virtual Reality club. She learned Unity and Unreal Engine and created a lighting-accurate copy of the Rose Art Museum, where they can not only prestage exhibits to see how they will flow in the space, they can re-create past exhibits that no longer exist -- including Louise Nevelson’s exhibit from the 1960’s that was lost in a fire. After creating the virtual space, Daniela created a 1:1 scale copy of the artwork lost in the fire, 3D printing over 20 pieces that assembled into a photo-realistic recreation of the lost sculpture."
