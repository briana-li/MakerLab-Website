Multiple experts will present case studies learned in the first years of creating spaces for digital fabrication. Participate in active discussions around practical hands on workshops, workflows, policies, and support models. Working groups, formed by attendees, will be asked to reverse engineer these case studies through the needs, policies, and resources of their own institution.</div>

The process of creating and exploring fosters a communal experience, whereby students are able to share innovations. As devices like 3D printers and scanners become more accessible, future implications for these spaces are boundless. </div>

                    <div class="info">This session will investigate the development of makerspaces at three liberal arts institutions: Brandeis University, Colgate University, and Wellesley College. Representatives from each institution will discuss the development of learning spaces that support a variety of "making" technologies, with a focus on 3D modeling and printing. Our talk will highlight key factors (e.g., awareness, access, physical space, campus policies, equipment, etc.) that influence the design, development, and support of these spaces. Join the conversation to share your questions, thoughts, problems, and solutions as we establish guidelines for makerspace design, development, and support.</div>

                    <div class="info">Wellesley and Brandeis have taken different journeys on the path toward creating makerspaces, but the point at which they meet is rich with interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration. These two liberal arts institutions have both created makerspaces in the past year with a focus on providing access to emerging technologies and introducing users to an interdisciplinary approach to the practice, culture, and values of making. Come work together to build a NERCOMP makerspace toy box, where you can play with maker tools, take a 3D portrait, try out 3D scanning and modeling software, play with LittleBits circuits, visit a strange world in Oculus Rift, and more. Share your makerspace thoughts, ideas, paradigms, approaches, challenges, and triumphs. Feel free to come and go during this experimental, hands-on, and participatory session.</div>
